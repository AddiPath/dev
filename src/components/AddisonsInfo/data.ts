    summary: "A comprehensive overview of primary adrenal insufficiency",
    content: `Addison's disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency, occurs when your adrenal glands are damaged and cannot produce enough of two essential hormones: cortisol and aldosterone.

Key Points:
• Affects approximately 1 in 100,000 people
• Results from damage to the adrenal glands
• Requires lifelong hormone replacement therapy
• Can be life-threatening if untreated

The adrenal glands, located above the kidneys, are essential for:
• Stress response
• Blood pressure regulation
• Electrolyte balance
• Energy metabolism`,

Primary Symptoms:
• Extreme fatigue
• Weight loss and decreased appetite
• Darkening of skin (hyperpigmentation)
• Low blood pressure
• Salt craving
• Low blood sugar

Additional Symptoms:
• Nausea and vomiting
• Abdominal pain
• Muscle and joint pain
• Depression and irritability
• Body hair loss (in women)

These symptoms often develop slowly over months and can be easily missed or attributed to other conditions.`,

1. Blood Tests:
• ACTH stimulation test
• Cortisol levels
• Aldosterone levels
• Plasma renin activity
• Electrolyte levels

2. Imaging:
• CT scan of adrenal glands
• MRI in some cases

3. Additional Testing:
• Anti-adrenal antibodies
• Morning cortisol levels
• Plasma ACTH levels

Early diagnosis is crucial for proper management and preventing adrenal crisis.`,

    content: `Hormone replacement therapy is the primary treatment for Addison's disease:

Medications:
1. Glucocorticoids (usually hydrocortisone or prednisolone):
   • Replaces cortisol
   • Usually taken 2-3 times daily
   • Dose adjustments needed during illness or stress

2. Mineralocorticoids (fludrocortisone):
   • Replaces aldosterone
   • Usually taken once daily
   • Helps maintain salt and water balance

Key Management Points:
• Never skip doses
• Carry emergency injection kit
• Wear medical identification
• Regular medical check-ups
• Learn to adjust doses when needed`,
